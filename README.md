# NYC Taxi Fare and Trip Duration Prediction

**Industries:** Transportation, Ridesharing, Logistics

**Technologies and Tools:** Supervised Learning, Neural Networks, Time-series analysis, Scikit-learn, Pandas, TensorFlow, HTTP APIs, Docker

**Difficulty Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

This project predicts taxi ride fares and durations in New York City using readily available data at the start of a ride.  This includes pickup and dropoff coordinates, trip distance, start time, number of passengers, and rate code (standard or airport).

Accurate fare and duration predictions are crucial for both passengers and drivers.  Passengers can make informed decisions about their commute, while drivers can assess profitability between potential rides.  For taxi companies, fare transparency can attract customers, especially during peak hours when ridesharing services often implement surge pricing.

This project will develop predictive models for both fare and duration.  These models will be trained and tested on a dataset of NYC taxi rides.  Performance will be evaluated based on prediction accuracy.

Beyond basic prediction, this project can be extended to:

* **Analyze influencing factors:** Explore how factors like traffic, weather, and road closures impact fares and durations.  These insights can help taxi companies optimize operations and improve customer satisfaction.
* **Predict taxi demand:**  Forecast the number of pickups in specific regions. This information can be invaluable for dispatchers in making strategic decisions to maximize profitability.

This project offers a practical application of machine learning techniques to real-world transportation data, providing valuable insights into the NYC transportation landscape.
